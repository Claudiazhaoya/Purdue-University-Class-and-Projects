I was able to get the grammar for this part implemted along with some of the symbol table. 
I fixed most of the error reporting but still  having issues with it reportin either to many or to little times
Had issues with the AST in order for it to compile and run with any semblince of correctness I left it out of this submission . I am going to work on it
for the rest of the semester.
