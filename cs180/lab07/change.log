7.1)  It would be better to use command line when dealing with file systems and os because it offers more 
control. Also when speed is of the essance.
	GUI would be better for basic users when doing basic tasks and for multitasking

7.2) Modal dialog is when the user must interact with the dialog box before contining what they were doing 
where as modeless is they can use the window without closeing out of the dialgo box. One area where you would 
want dialog is closing an unsaved word document. One where you would maybe want modeless is an error message
that a program is needed to close. 

7.3)  You would use Icon when you want a specific image to appear in the box such as during a warning a yellow
triangle with a elecmation point
	Message: would be any message that you want displayed to the user
	Title: I would use this to give a very brief description of what the box does such as for an error
		it would say error
	Message Type: For normal messages I would use Information Message
	Componet: If you do not want it to be defualt you can specify the size location and all other aspects 
		of the dialog window.
		
7.4) I would say that the first of the two options prsented would be best. There might be some odd corner case
where the value of response would make it so that second option would give a pass when it should not.
