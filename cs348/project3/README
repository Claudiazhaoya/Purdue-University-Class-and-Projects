I have included a make file all you have to do is type make into the terminal and it will compile and 
run the code.
	if you do not want to use the make file the command is
		javac -cp ojdbc6.jar:. RBAC.java
		java -cp ojdbc6.jar:. RBAC
	if you have to drop the tables and rest. there is a drop tables file
	then  you have the tables file to reset the tables and a admin file
	that addes an admin to the table

I may have misspelled authorization or successfully someplace but i think i found all those errors
I also noticed at one point that my output was not in the same order as the one provided on piazza 
other than the output tuples in the wrong order the output was correct


I have another class that is using a SQL database. the values and table in there could mess with the output
I will wait as long as I can before modifing the database as to ensure that does not happen 
but i might have to for that class
